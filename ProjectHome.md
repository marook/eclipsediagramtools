# Installation #
The Eclipse Diagram Tools are installed via the Eclipse Software Update mechanism. But first you need a Eclipse Ganymede installation with the EMF and GMF plug-ins. So first download the [Eclipse Modeling Tools Bundle](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-modeling-tools-includes-incubating-components/ganymedesr2).

Then you can install the Eclipse Diagram Tools from the Eclipse Diagram Tools Update Site on google code: http://eclipsediagramtools.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/workspaces/edt/edt.update_site/

# How To Use #
  1. Create an empty project.
  1. Create a new diagram. You can do this in the menu File -> New -> Other... -> Examples -> Arch Diagram
  1. Finish the wizard and then you're ready to start editing your diagram.

# Reference Projects #
